Examining 3-dimensional distributions of species and their traits.

## 3D climate velocity
Climate velocity describes the speed and direction that species are expected to shift locally in response to climate change. However, studies have not previously incorporated impacts of vegetation on microclimates across the land surface and vertically from the ground to the canopy. We examine how accounting for vegetation impacts local climate velocities in two and three dimensions. This work expands methods used to calculate local climate velocities to incorporate a third dimension from the ground to the canopy, allowing us to examine how arboreal species may respond to climate change using vertical climate gradients.
