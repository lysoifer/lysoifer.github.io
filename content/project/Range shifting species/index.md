        Through a series of projects, I am examining how spatial and temporal climate variability, such near-groung microclimates and extreme weather events, impact species' range shifts.

        In a recent paper, we find that fine-scale microclimate variability on the ground and three-dimensionally in forest canopies reduces climate velocities and alters their direction. This suggests that forest-dwelling species may be able to move toward denser vegetation or lower positions in the canopy (if arboreal) as temporary refuge from extreme heat. We are now examining similar questions at a global scale.

        Extreme weather and climate events are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Here, we proposte that EWCEs are amplifying range edge dynamics, with the potential to speed up both range expansion and contraction at leading and trailing edges.
